# OUM — Full Audit Report (Phase 1)

**Date:** 2026-09-28  
**Scope:** Full repository `vovo-agent-ai` (Next.js 15.5.25 / React 19.3 / Prisma 5.22 / Neon PostgreSQL / Tailwind CSS), customer site, dashboard, admin panel, APIs, libraries, security controls, and repository hygiene.  
**Method:** End-to-end static code analysis, data flow tracing, and authorized penetration testing across all public and protected surfaces.  
**Engagement Rule:** **PHASE 1 (AUDIT ONLY)** — No functional code was changed during this audit review.

---

## 1. Executive Summary

### Overall Health & Architectural Assessment
OUM is an autonomous, AI-driven YouTube channel management platform with a sophisticated multi-stage pipeline (Channel Connection → Niche Research → DeepSeek Scripting & Compliance → Asset Generation → Scheduled Publishing). 

Recent remediation hardened several foundational layers:
- **Admin authentication**: Argon2/scrypt password hashing, TOTP 2FA, brute-force lockout, timing-safe error flows, `sameSite=strict` httpOnly cookies, owner allow-listing, and middleware gate redirection to `/`.
- **Zero raw SQL / Zero injection surface**: Prisma parameterized queries exclusively — no `$queryRaw` or `$executeRaw`.
- **Zero XSS surface**: No unsafe HTML injection (`dangerouslySetInnerHTML` only used for static JSON-LD metadata).
- **YouTube OAuth security**: CSRF `state` verification + tokens encrypted (AES-256-GCM) before database persistence.
- **Remediated Critical & High Findings**:
  - The cross-tenant IDOR vulnerability on `channelId` has been closed (`linkChannelToNiche`, `createContentItem`, and `/api/niche/mistake` now strictly enforce channel ownership).
  - Public niche knowledge exposure in `/api/niche/knowledge` is sealed behind session authentication (HTTP 401).
  - Rate limiting has been upgraded with Upstash Redis and persistent PostgreSQL security events, eliminating cold-start resets on serverless deployments.
  - Video and thumbnail generation fallbacks no longer return mock Google sample videos or stock photos as "ready for review" — they report honest status states.
  - Admin settings, plans, promo codes, free grants, and user notices now persist directly into PostgreSQL tables (`SystemSetting`, `PromoCode`, `FreeGrant`, `UserNotice`).

### Top 5 Most Urgent Remaining Issues

| # | Issue | Category | Severity | Impact |
|---|-------|----------|----------|--------|
| **1** | **Sitemap & Robots Domain Mismatch** (`SEO-1` / `FUNC-8`) | SEO / Backend | 🟠 High | `app/sitemap.ts` and `app/robots.ts` read undefined `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL` and fall back to `https://vovo-agent.ai`, while the real production host is `https://vovo-five.vercel.app` (configured as `NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL`). Search engines will index the wrong domain. |
| **2** | **Simulated Billing Without Live Provider** (`FUNC-5` / `SEC-9`) | Billing / Compliance | 🟡 Medium | `app/api/subscribe/route.ts` collects raw credit card numbers (PAN, expiry, CVC) without a PCI-compliant hosted fields provider (e.g., Stripe Elements). Even though cards are simulated with test delays, collecting PANs places the app into full PCI-DSS scope. |
| **3** | **Every-Load Intro Overlay UX & Accessibility Gate** (`UI-2` / `A11Y-1`) | UI / Accessibility | 🟡 Medium | `components/marketing/intro-sequence.tsx` forces a 10.4-second overlay on every single fresh page load across the entire site (marketing, auth, dashboard) without session memory, violating WCAG 2.2.2 and creating high visitor bounce risk. |
| **4** | **Excessive Artificial Navigation Latency** (`UI-3`) | UX / Performance | 🟡 Medium | `components/ui/loading-overlay.tsx` forces an artificial `LOADER_MIN_MS` of 4.0 seconds (8 stages × 500 ms) on internal page navigations even when the target route is already rendered and ready in <200 ms. |
| **5** | **CSP & Security Header Hardening** (`SEC-5`) | Security | 🟡 Medium | `middleware.ts` includes `'unsafe-eval'` in its CSP script directive, lacks `Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy: same-origin`, and excludes `/api` from receiving security headers. |

## 2. Findings — 1. Codebase & Project Structure

### STR-1 🟡 Duplicated Plan Price Sources (Risk of Financial Drift)
- **Location:** `lib/plans.ts` (base definitions) · `messages/en.json` (`pricing.*`) · `lib/admin/data.ts` (`PLAN_PRICE_CENTS`) · `app/[locale]/(marketing)/pricing/page.tsx`.
- **Description:** Plan prices and tier details are defined across multiple files. The pricing page initializes from localized strings, then merges data from `/api/plans`; checkout relies on `lib/plans.ts`; MRR calculation in admin overview utilizes a static cents map. Any change to a plan's price in one file can cause financial drift between the marketing display, checkout charge, and financial reporting.
- **Recommended Fix:** Unify plan pricing and tier configuration into a single source of truth (the database `SystemSetting` / `Plan` records, falling back to `lib/plans.ts`). Ensure MRR, checkout, and pricing UI read from this single source.

### STR-2 🟡 Dead Code and Leftover Files
- **Location:**
  - `components/marketing/hero-canvas.tsx`: Unused 3D/canvas component leftover from earlier design iterations; unreferenced by any import.
  - `lib/i18n/config.ts`: Legacy bilingual routing config (`locales: ['en', 'ar']`); real routing is strictly handled by `lib/i18n/routing.ts` (English single locale).
  - `lib/admin/secrets.ts`: Functions `readEnvLocal()` and `writeEnvLocalKeys()` attempt to read and write `.env.local` on disk. In serverless production environments (such as Vercel), the filesystem is read-only and ephemeral; these functions fail silently.
  - `app/api/billing/route.ts`: Unreferenced endpoint; client code uses `/api/billing/status` and `/api/billing/invoices`.
  - `messages/en.json`: Contains orphaned translation keys (`settings.notifications.*`, `contentCalendar.filter.*`).
- **Recommended Fix:** Delete unused files and orphaned keys to reduce bundle size and prevent developer confusion.

### STR-3 🟢 Repository & Version Control Hygiene
- **Location:** `.gitignore` (lines 45–46) · Project root · `package.json` (line 14).
- **Description:**
  - `.gitignore` has duplicate trailing blocks (`.vercel` and `.env*` are appended twice).
  - Stray local development build artifacts (`dev-out.log`, `dev-err.log`, `tsconfig.tsbuildinfo`) exist in the project root.
  - `README.md` is the generic `create-next-app` boilerplate (referencing Geist font and `app/page.tsx`).
  - `@types/nodemailer` is listed in `dependencies` instead of `devDependencies`.
- **Recommended Fix:** Clean up duplicate gitignore rules, remove stray log files, update `README.md` to reflect the actual project architecture, and move `@types/nodemailer` to `devDependencies`.

### STR-4 🟢 Separation of Concerns
- **Location:** `lib/admin/secrets.ts` vs `lib/admin/data.ts`.
- **Description:** `lib/admin/secrets.ts` mixes crypto operations (AES-256-GCM), filesystem parsing, and DB access. Separation can be improved by isolating crypto utilities into a dedicated `lib/crypto/encryption.ts` module.

---

## 3. Findings — 2. Frontend / UI / Visual Review

### UI-1 🟡 Carousel Typography Inconsistency
- **Location:** `components/reactbits/Carousel.css` (lines 117 and 133).
- **Description:** The carousel card titles and descriptions specify `font-family: var(--font-arabic, "Noto Sans Arabic")`. Because the site was converted to an English-first interface, English marketing copy on the hero carousel renders using the Arabic font stack rather than Fraunces and Inter, creating an unintended typographical inconsistency.
- **Recommended Fix:** Update `Carousel.css` to use `var(--font-fraunces)` for titles and `var(--font-inter)` for body text.

### UI-2 🟡 Intro Sequence Overlay on Every Page Load (UX Friction)
- **Location:** `components/marketing/intro-sequence.tsx` · `app/layout.tsx`.
- **Description:** The intro sequence animation runs for ~10.4 seconds (`STEP_MS = 1200` across 8 stages) on every single hard page load and browser refresh. Returning users, authenticated clients, and visitors navigating directly to pricing or legal terms are blocked by this animation.
- **Recommended Fix:** Store an `intro_seen` flag in `sessionStorage` (or a short-lived cookie) so the animation only plays once per session. Respect `prefers-reduced-motion` by skipping immediately.

### UI-3 🟡 Excessive Artificial Loading Overlay Minimum Duration
- **Location:** `components/ui/loading-overlay.tsx` (line 16: `LOADER_MIN_MS = PIPELINE_COUNT * MS_PER_STAGE = 4000ms`).
- **Description:** On page navigation, the overlay forces an artificial 4-second delay to complete an 8-stage 3D rotation, even when Next.js has already resolved and pre-rendered the route in milliseconds. This degrades real-world perceived performance.
- **Recommended Fix:** Allow the overlay to smoothly fade out as soon as the target page mounts and a minimum optical threshold (e.g., 800–1200 ms) has elapsed.

### UI-4 🟢 Visual Hierarchy & Button Tokens
- **Location:** `app/[locale]/(marketing)/page.tsx` (Hero H1) · Global buttons.
- **Description:** Hero H1 uses arbitrary Tailwind utility classes `text-[2.75rem] sm:text-[4rem]` instead of the design system's defined `text-display-lg` / `text-display-xl` tokens. Some interactive buttons have inconsistent hover/active scale states.
- **Recommended Fix:** Standardize typography and interactive motion classes onto unified design tokens.

### UI-5 🟢 Content Calendar Fallback Items
- **Location:** `app/[locale]/(dashboard)/content-calendar/page.tsx`.
- **Description:** When a newly connected channel has zero scheduled content items, the view displays hardcoded demo items ("Tech Insights", "How AI is changing content") rather than a clean, helpful onboarding empty state.
- **Recommended Fix:** Replace demo item fallbacks with an onboarding card guiding the creator to initiate their first AI production run.

## 4. Findings — 3. Backend Review

### FUNC-1 ✅ Admin Data Layer Persistence (Remediated)
- **Location:** `lib/admin/data.ts` · `prisma/schema.prisma`.
- **Status:** **REMEDIATED**.
- **Details:** Previously, `updatePlan()` was a silent no-op when `usingDatabase()` was true, and promo codes, free grants, and auto-trial settings vanished upon serverless cold restart. Four dedicated database models (`SystemSetting`, `PromoCode`, `FreeGrant`, `UserNotice`) were introduced into `schema.prisma` and synchronized with Neon PostgreSQL. All admin operations now perform transactional database queries with in-memory fallbacks.

### FUNC-2 ✅ Review Action Return & Audit Action Typo (Remediated)
- **Location:** `lib/services/content.ts` (lines 121–140) · `app/api/content/[id]/approve/route.ts`.
- **Status:** **REMEDIATED**.
- **Details:** `applyReviewAction()` previously lacked a return statement (causing endpoints to return empty bodies) and produced a malformed audit string (`content.rejectd`). This was corrected: the updated item is returned and actions are mapped to explicit constants (`content.approved`, `content.rejected`, `content.changes_requested`).

### FUNC-3 ✅ Cross-Tenant Content Creation Ownership (Remediated)
- **Location:** `app/api/content/route.ts` · `lib/services/content.ts`.
- **Status:** **REMEDIATED**.
- **Details:** See `SEC-1` below.

### FUNC-4 🟡 Server-Side Promo Code Application at Checkout
- **Location:** `app/api/subscribe/route.ts` · `app/[locale]/checkout/page.tsx`.
- **Description:** The checkout UI validates promo codes visually, but the subscription endpoint must ensure the discounted price is verified server-side, `maxUses` is enforced, and `usedCount` is incremented atomically.
- **Recommended Fix:** Pass `promoCode` in the `/api/subscribe` request body, re-verify validity on the server via `validatePromoCode()`, compute the discounted price, and increment `usedCount` upon successful subscription creation.

### FUNC-5 🟡 Simulated Billing with Unhosted Payment Card Inputs
- **Location:** `app/api/subscribe/route.ts` · `app/[locale]/checkout/page.tsx`.
- **Description:** The checkout page presents full credit card number, expiry, and CVC input fields. In the backend, the card number undergoes Luhn validation, followed by a simulated 1600 ms timeout and plan activation without communicating with an external payment gateway (e.g., Stripe, Paddle).
- **Impact:** Collecting raw payment card account numbers (PANs) on self-hosted input fields brings the application under PCI-DSS compliance scope, even if numbers are discarded after simulation.
- **Recommended Fix:** Either clearly label the checkout as "Test / Demo Checkout — Do not enter real card details", or integrate Stripe Elements / Paddle hosted iframe fields prior to public commercial launch.

### FUNC-6 ✅ Admin Overview Live Metrics (Remediated)
- **Location:** `lib/admin/data.ts` (`getOverview`).
- **Status:** **REMEDIATED**.
- **Details:** Previously, `newUsersThisMonth: 0` and `uptime: "99.98%"` were hardcoded. The endpoint now computes real monthly user growth via `prisma.user.count({ where: { createdAt: { gte: monthAgo } } })`, backlog items via `prisma.contentItem.count({ where: { status: { in: ['SCRIPT', 'GENERATING'] } } })`, and reports dynamic server process uptime.

### FUNC-7 ✅ Mail Provider Error Sanitization (Remediated)
- **Location:** `app/api/auth/otp/send/route.ts`.
- **Status:** **REMEDIATED**.
- **Details:** Raw SMTP failure messages (such as upstream authentication or IP rejection codes) are now captured in server-side logs, while the client receives a secure, generic status message.

### FUNC-8 🟠 Sitemap and Robots Hostname Misconfiguration
- **Location:** `app/sitemap.ts` (line 5) · `app/robots.ts` (line 4).
- **Description:** Both generators read `process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL || 'https://vovo-agent.ai'`. The actual production host environment variable is `NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL` (`https://vovo-five.vercel.app`). Because `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL` is undefined, production `sitemap.xml` and `robots.txt` output links pointing to the placeholder domain `https://vovo-agent.ai`.
- **Recommended Fix:** Standardize both files to read `process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL || process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL`.

### FUNC-9 🟢 Input Length Limits on Contact & Support Endpoints
- **Location:** `app/api/contact/route.ts` · `app/api/support/tickets/route.ts`.
- **Description:** The contact form and support ticket creation routes accept unbounded string inputs for `subject`, `message`, and `description`. Large payloads consume database storage and flow into administrative notification emails.
- **Recommended Fix:** Enforce length constraints (e.g., maximum 200 characters for subjects, 2,000 characters for messages/descriptions).

## 5. Findings — 4. Security Audit & Penetration Testing

### SEC-1 🟠 IDOR — Cross-Tenant Channel Writes (Remediated & Verified)
- **Location:** `app/api/niche/ensure/route.ts` · `app/api/content/route.ts` · `lib/niche/service.ts` · `app/api/niche/mistake/route.ts`.
- **Severity:** 🟠 High
- **Pre-Fix Vulnerability:**
  - `POST /api/niche/ensure` accepted arbitrary `channelId` and updated `prisma.channel.update({ where: { id: channelId } })` with no `userId` filter.
  - `POST /api/content` accepted arbitrary `channelId` and attached new content items to any channel.
- **Remediation Implemented:**
  - Implemented channel ownership checks before any modification:
    ```ts
    const channel = await prisma.channel.findFirst({
      where: { id: channelId, userId: session.userId },
      select: { id: true },
    });
    if (!channel) {
      return NextResponse.json({ error: "Channel not found or unauthorized" }, { status: 404 });
    }
    ```
  - Added user ownership validation to `linkChannelToNiche(channelId, niche, session.userId)` and `createContentItem()`.
- **Status:** **REMEDIATED & VERIFIED**.

### SEC-2 🟠 Demo Account Entitlement Bypass (Remediated & Verified)
- **Location:** `lib/billing/subscription-service.ts` (`checkUserAccess`).
- **Severity:** 🟠 High
- **Pre-Fix Vulnerability:**
  - When `DATABASE_URL` was configured but a user had no active database subscription, `checkUserAccess` fell through to the in-memory demo store (`getUserRecord`). A visitor signing up with a seeded demo email (e.g. `ahmed@example.com` or `sara@example.com`) received automatic active access to the GROWTH plan for free.
- **Remediation Implemented:**
  - Gated the demo store fallback strictly behind `if (!process.env.DATABASE_URL)`. When the database is active, entitlement is evaluated solely via database subscriptions, database free grants, and database auto-trial records.
- **Status:** **REMEDIATED & VERIFIED**.

### SEC-3 🟡 Public Niche Knowledge Information Exposure (Remediated & Verified)
- **Location:** `app/api/niche/knowledge/route.ts`.
- **Severity:** 🟡 Medium
- **Pre-Fix Vulnerability:**
  - The endpoint answered unauthenticated GET requests, leaking competitive analysis, best practices, and mistake logs across all niches without requiring a login session.
- **Remediation Implemented:**
  - Added `const session = await getSession(); if (!session) return NextResponse.json({ ok: false, error: 'Unauthorized' }, { status: 401 });`.
- **Status:** **REMEDIATED & VERIFIED**.

### SEC-4 🟡 Rate Limiting Cold-Start Resilience & AI Endpoint Throttling (Remediated & Verified)
- **Location:** `lib/security/guardian.ts` · `app/api/agent/chat/route.ts` · `app/api/niche/analyze/route.ts` · `app/api/content/route.ts` · `app/api/auth/otp/send/route.ts`.
- **Severity:** 🟡 Medium
- **Pre-Fix Vulnerability:**
  - Rate limiting relied on in-memory JavaScript `Map` objects, resetting on every serverless cold start. AI endpoints (`/api/agent/chat`, `/api/niche/analyze`) had zero rate limiting, leaving DeepSeek and Tavily/Serper quotas vulnerable to rapid exhaustion.
- **Remediation Implemented:**
  - Wired `checkRateLimit()` to Upstash Redis (`@/lib/db/redis`) with atomic `INCR` + `PEXPIRE`.
  - Implemented persistent database fallback via `SecurityEvent` so temporary lockouts persist across serverless instances even without Redis.
  - Implemented rate limits on:
    - `/api/agent/chat`: 10 requests / min per user.
    - `/api/niche/analyze`: 5 requests / min per user.
    - `POST /api/content`: 15 requests / min per user.
    - `POST /api/content/[id]/generate`: 5 requests / min per user.
    - `POST /api/auth/otp/send`: 5 requests / min per IP address.
- **Status:** **REMEDIATED & VERIFIED**.

### SEC-5 🟡 CSP & Security Header Hardening
- **Location:** `middleware.ts` (lines 48–79, 142).
- **Severity:** 🟡 Medium
- **Findings:**
  1. The CSP `script-src` directive includes `'unsafe-eval'`. While useful during certain local development workflows, production builds do not require `'unsafe-eval'`.
  2. The headers lack `Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy: same-origin` (COOP), which helps defend against cross-origin window interaction attacks.
  3. The middleware matcher `["/((?!api|_next|_vercel|.*\\..*).*)"]` excludes `/api`. Consequently, API responses do not carry `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff` or frame protection headers.
- **Recommended Fix:** Remove `'unsafe-eval'` in production; add `Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy: same-origin`; apply security headers to API route responses via `next.config.mjs` or middleware header rules.

### SEC-6 ✅ Hardcoded Admin Email Fallback (Remediated)
- **Location:** `app/api/admin/auth/login/route.ts` (line 17).
- **Status:** **REMEDIATED**.
- **Details:** The admin login route previously defaulted to `oren.on.oren.25@gmail.com` if `ADMIN_EMAIL` was unset. It now fails closed immediately with an explicit 500 error if `process.env.ADMIN_EMAIL` is missing.

### SEC-7 🟢 Encryption Key Material Fallback
- **Location:** `lib/admin/secrets.ts` (line 14).
- **Severity:** 🟢 Low
- **Details:** If both `SECRETS_ENCRYPTION_KEY` and `NEXTAUTH_SECRET` are unset, the key generator falls back to the hardcoded string `"vovo-dev-insecure-do-not-use-prod"`. In production, both environment variables are set, but defense-in-depth requires throwing an explicit configuration error rather than falling back to a static key.

### SEC-8 🟢 CSRF Posture on Mutation Endpoints
- **Location:** `app/api/contact/route.ts` · `app/api/subscribe/route.ts` · `app/api/promo/validate/route.ts`.
- **Severity:** 🟢 Low
- **Details:** State-changing requests rely on `SameSite=Lax` cookies and JSON-encoded bodies. For additional defense-in-depth against cross-site form submissions from modern browser fetch requests, validate that the incoming `Origin` or `Referer` header matches `process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL`.

### SEC-9 🟢 Credit Card Data Collection Without Tokenization
- **Location:** `app/[locale]/checkout/page.tsx` · `app/api/subscribe/route.ts`.
- **Severity:** 🟢 Low
- **Details:** Described under `FUNC-5`. Replace raw input fields with tokenized hosted iframe components before accepting real credit card information.

### SEC-10 🟢 AI Copilot System Prompt Hardening
- **Location:** `app/api/agent/chat/route.ts`.
- **Severity:** 🟢 Low
- **Details:** The system prompt explicitly instructs the AI never to reveal or manipulate account credentials or financial data. Because the route does not execute arbitrary tool calls or database mutations based on the model's output, prompt injection risk is limited to conversational responses. Keep system prompts immutable and validate all downstream state transitions.

## 6. Findings — 5. Performance

### PERF-1 🟡 Unused Font Shipped in Global Bundle
- **Location:** `app/layout.tsx` (lines 26–31).
- **Description:** `Noto_Sans_Arabic` is initialized via `next/font/google` and injected into the root HTML element. Following the interface's conversion to English, the Arabic font files (~100–150 KB) are downloaded by every client browser unnecessarily.
- **Recommended Fix:** Remove `Noto_Sans_Arabic` from `app/layout.tsx` (or load it conditionally only if Arabic localized routes are accessed).

### PERF-2 🟡 Unoptimized PWA Asset (`icon-512.png`)
- **Location:** `public/icon-512.png`.
- **Description:** The 512×512 icon is 239.6 KB, whereas `icon-192.png` is 35.5 KB.
- **Recommended Fix:** Compress `icon-512.png` using modern lossless compression tools (target size: <50 KB).

### PERF-3 🟢 Bundle Composition & Code Splitting
- **Location:** Client pages (`/analytics`, `/dashboard`, `/login`).
- **Evaluation:** Strong. Heavy charting libraries (`recharts`) are scoped exclusively to `/analytics`. Authentication SDKs (`firebase`) load only on the login view. Common JavaScript across marketing pages is ~102 KB.

### PERF-4 🟢 Data Caching Architecture
- **Location:** `lib/youtube/data-api.ts` · `lib/services/search-service.ts`.
- **Evaluation:** YouTube Data API responses are cached in the `YouTubeCache` database table with TTLs to conserve the 10,000 daily quota units. Web search queries use `SearchCache` with provider failover.

---

## 7. Findings — 6. Accessibility & SEO

### A11Y-1 🟡 Intro Sequence Accessibility & Motion Controls
- **Location:** `components/marketing/intro-sequence.tsx`.
- **Description:** The overlay acts as a visual blocker for 10.4 seconds. It lacks focus containment, does not mark background siblings `aria-hidden="true"`, and re-triggers on hard reloads regardless of OS-level reduced motion preferences.
- **Recommended Fix:** Honor `prefers-reduced-motion: reduce`, remember skip state in `sessionStorage`, and trap keyboard focus inside the overlay while visible.

### A11Y-2 🟡 Modal Focus Management
- **Location:** `components/ui/modal.tsx`.
- **Description:** The modal sets `role="dialog"` and `aria-modal="true"` and handles Escape keys, but does not move focus into the dialog upon opening or restore focus to the triggering element upon closing.
- **Recommended Fix:** Add focus trapping (e.g. focusing the first interactive element or the close button on mount, and returning focus to `document.activeElement` on unmount).

### A11Y-3 🟢 Navbar Accessibility Details
- **Location:** `components/ui/navbar.tsx` (lines 40–55, 77).
- **Description:** The mobile hamburger button has `aria-label="Toggle menu"` but lacks `aria-expanded={mobileOpen}`. On desktop, the active route's navigation link hides itself with CSS (`max-w-0 opacity-0`), removing the current page link from screen reader tab order.
- **Recommended Fix:** Add `aria-expanded={mobileOpen}` and retain the active link with an `aria-current="page"` indicator instead of collapsing it.

### SEO-1 🟠 Sitemap & Robots Pointing to Placeholder Host
- **Location:** `app/sitemap.ts` · `app/robots.ts`.
- **Severity:** 🟠 High (See `FUNC-8`).

### SEO-2 🟢 Missing OpenGraph and Twitter Metadata
- **Location:** `app/layout.tsx` (lines 33–58).
- **Description:** The application metadata includes `title`, `description`, `manifest`, and `icons`, but lacks `openGraph` and `twitter` card objects. Links shared on social platforms (LinkedIn, X, Discord) will render without preview cards.
- **Recommended Fix:** Add `openGraph` and `twitter` configurations with preview images.

---

## 8. Findings — 7. Admin Panel Review

### ADM-1 ✅ Database Persistence of Admin Controls (Remediated)
- **Status:** **REMEDIATED**. Plan pricing edits, promo codes, free grants, auto-trial toggles, user warnings, and account reports persist in PostgreSQL.

### ADM-2 🟢 Visual Consistency & Design Language
- **Evaluation:** The admin panel (`vovo-hq-secure-gateway`) utilizes the site's palette (warm paper background, refined borders, dark ink typography, gold accents). Layouts, status badges, and typography align with the customer dashboard.

### ADM-3 🟢 Admin Security Gate
- **Evaluation:** Protected by a strict two-layer barrier:
  1. Edge middleware gate: redirects unauthenticated users or non-admin roles to `/` as if the panel does not exist.
  2. Per-route verification: Every admin API route (`/api/admin/*`) invokes `getAdminSession()` and verifies the owner's encrypted cookie.
  3. Login defense: Timing-safe scrypt verification, TOTP 2FA, IP-based rate limiting, and brute-force lockout.

## 9. Improvement & Innovation Ideas (Creative Proposals)

### Design & Animation Enhancements
1. **Intro Sequence as a "Premiere", Not a Gate**:
   - Play the cinematic intro once per user session (stored in `sessionStorage`).
   - If the user clicks "Skip", store the preference so it never interrupts workflow navigation.
   - Offer an optional "Watch Intro" or "Pipeline Tour" button in the footer for visitors who wish to re-watch it.
2. **Carousel Micro-Polish & Typography Alignment**:
   - Switch carousel cards to `var(--font-fraunces)` for titles and `var(--font-inter)` for body text.
   - Add a subtle optical depth scale (e.g. `scale: 1.02` with a soft gold border glow) to the active center card.
3. **Adaptive Loading Overlay**:
   - Replace the fixed 4.0-second delay with an adaptive loader: if the next route loads in under 300 ms, skip the overlay entirely; if it takes longer, display an elegant ring indicator that fades out immediately when the page renders.
4. **Unified Spring Motion Language**:
   - Consolidate button hover, card hover, modal entrance, and tab transitions under shared Framer Motion / CSS transition tokens (`cubic-bezier(0.16, 1, 0.3, 1)`).

### Site Settings & Configuration
5. **Centralized Settings Management in Admin Panel**:
   - Provide an admin UI section under "Settings" to manage platform variables: support contact email, default trial duration, maintenance mode toggle, and notification banners.
6. **Centralized Environment Validator (Zod)**:
   - Introduce a boot-time environment schema validator (`lib/env.ts`) that asserts `NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL`, `DATABASE_URL`, and SMTP keys are well-formed at build/startup time, outputting actionable configuration warnings.
7. **Unified Domain Variable**:
   - Consolidate all domain references (`sitemap.ts`, `robots.ts`, OAuth callbacks, email links) onto `NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL`.

### Customer-Facing UX Simplifications
8. **Onboarding Progress Spine & Resume**:
   - Save onboarding state (Plan Selected → Channel Linked → Niche Analyzed → Avatar Turnaround Saved) in the database. If a user drops off during channel connection, resume directly from the incomplete step upon next login.
9. **One-Click Channel Re-Authentication**:
   - If a channel's OAuth access token expires or is revoked, display a prominent 1-click "Refresh YouTube Authorization" banner on the dashboard without requiring full account re-setup.
10. **Human-Readable Content Statuses**:
    - Replace raw database enum labels (`IDEA`, `SCRIPT`, `GENERATING`, `READY_FOR_REVIEW`) with friendly status explanations:
      - `SCRIPT` → "AI Strategist is drafting script & compliance checks"
      - `GENERATING` → "Generating video & thumbnail assets"
      - `READY_FOR_REVIEW` → "Ready for your 1-click review"
11. **Clear Checkout Transparency**:
    - Add a distinct "Preview / Sandbox Checkout Mode" badge on the checkout screen while simulated billing is active, ensuring users know real cards will not be charged.

### Admin Panel Feature Improvements
12. **Live Service Health & Quota Dashboard**:
    - Add a real-time health widget in the Admin Overview displaying live provider states:
      - Tavily search queries remaining this month.
      - YouTube Data API daily units consumed.
      - Database latency and Neon connection pool status.
      - Upstash Redis ping / rate limit counter status.
13. **Guardian Security Digest Email**:
    - Configure an automated daily or weekly email digest to the owner summarizing blocked login attempts, rate limit spikes, and new user registrations.
14. **Audit Log Export (CSV / JSON)**:
    - Add a 1-click export button in the Audit Logs tab to download compliance and security logs for external archiving.

## 10. Prioritized Action Checklist

*Approve items individually to proceed to Phase 2 (Implementation).*

### Priority 0 — Correctness & SEO Fixes (Immediate)
- [ ] **ACT-01** (`SEO-1` / `FUNC-8`): Standardize `app/sitemap.ts` and `app/robots.ts` to use `NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL`, ensuring production search engines index the live domain (`vovo-five.vercel.app`).
- [ ] **ACT-02** (`FUNC-5`): Add a clear "Demo / Sandbox Mode — No real charges" banner on `/checkout` and the subscribe modal, clarifying payment simulation until live Stripe/Paddle elements are connected.
- [ ] **ACT-03** (`UI-1`): Update `components/reactbits/Carousel.css` typography to use `var(--font-fraunces)` and `var(--font-inter)` instead of the Arabic font stack for English titles and descriptions.

### Priority 1 — UX Friction & Performance Tuning
- [ ] **ACT-04** (`UI-2` / `A11Y-1`): Add `sessionStorage` persistence to `components/marketing/intro-sequence.tsx` so the 10-second animation runs only once per user session; restore instant skip for `prefers-reduced-motion`.
- [ ] **ACT-05** (`UI-3`): Reduce artificial loading delay in `components/ui/loading-overlay.tsx` from 4.0 seconds to an adaptive exit once the target route is ready.
- [ ] **ACT-06** (`PERF-1`): Remove unused `Noto_Sans_Arabic` global font from `app/layout.tsx` to save ~100–150 KB of network payload on page load.
- [ ] **ACT-07** (`PERF-2`): Compress `public/icon-512.png` from ~240 KB down to <50 KB.

### Priority 2 — Security & Header Hardening
- [ ] **ACT-08** (`SEC-5`): Remove `'unsafe-eval'` from the Content-Security-Policy header in `middleware.ts`, add `Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy: same-origin`, and ensure security headers apply to `/api` routes.
- [ ] **ACT-09** (`SEC-7`): Remove the hardcoded fallback encryption key string in `lib/admin/secrets.ts`; throw an explicit error in production if `SECRETS_ENCRYPTION_KEY` and `NEXTAUTH_SECRET` are missing.
- [ ] **ACT-10** (`FUNC-9`): Add maximum string length validation on support ticket and contact form submissions.

### Priority 3 — Accessibility & SEO Polish
- [ ] **ACT-11** (`A11Y-2`): Add focus trapping and focus restoration on `components/ui/modal.tsx`.
- [ ] **ACT-12** (`A11Y-3`): Add `aria-expanded` to mobile hamburger button in `components/ui/navbar.tsx` and preserve active links in screen reader order.
- [ ] **ACT-13** (`SEO-2`): Add OpenGraph and Twitter card metadata to `app/layout.tsx`.
- [ ] **ACT-14** (`UI-5`): Replace demo content items in `content-calendar` with an empty-state action card.

### Priority 4 — Repository Hygiene & Dead Code Removal
- [ ] **ACT-15** (`STR-2`): Remove unused legacy files (`components/marketing/hero-canvas.tsx`, `lib/i18n/config.ts`, `app/api/billing/route.ts`).
- [ ] **ACT-16** (`STR-3`): Clean duplicate blocks in `.gitignore`, move `@types/nodemailer` to `devDependencies`, delete stray log files, and update `README.md`.
